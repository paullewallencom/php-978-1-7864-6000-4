## About the Video Course
The latest release of PHP has created a massive spark among developers, needless to say how popular a back-end scripting language it is. With this course, you'll get a deep insight into 3 cool projects that are built on PHP, and you'll learn different ways to improve your development.

Once you're familiar with setting up your environment and using the basic syntax of PHP, we'll begin with an entry-level project, where we'll show you how to build a URL shortener. You'll understand how to make effective use of MVC and how to connect up to the database. From there, we'll show you how to automate testing for our project and how to create functional tests. Next, we'll jump on to building an authentication platform, where you'll be introduced to Test Driven Development and CRUD, to create persistence storage. We'll show you the beauty of using the REST API and you'll also learn how to alleviate the load on the database. Finally, we'll build a social sharing platform, where we'll tighten the security and let users interact with each other in real-time.

With this course in your hands, you'll be confident of the practical use cases of PHP and will be ready to take your development skills to the next level.
